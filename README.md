# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis

The purpose of this challenge was to recalculate the school data within the district after removing the ninth graders from Thomas High School. The grades for all ninth graders were replaced with NaN while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once that is complete, the analysis for the district was repeated with the updated data.

## Results

* How is the district summary affected? 

Based on the analysis, the district was not affected much due to the large sample size of our data thus the metrics for the overall disctrict did not have much impact. Since only a small size (specifically 9th graders from Thomas High School) was removed, it understandably did not skew the district very much.

* How is the school summary affected?

In comparison to the district, the school did see a major change in its percentages. Before the grades were removed, the percentages all ranged within 65%-70% but after the grades were removed, all percentages increased drastically to 90%-97%.
